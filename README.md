PENTAHACKS 2018 Project

This project was developed with the Deloitte problem set in mind. The problem set asked for an application to ease the transfer of clients
from retiring relationship managers (RMs) to their colleagues and tackle the problem of training new RMs who have little experience dealing 
with clients. 

Our project's main focus was on connecting clients to existing RMs by use of various parameters such as age, assets, income, sex, marriage, etc. The 
clients were given a choice of which RM traits they desired and the algorithm would produce a list of RMs to match those desires. This eased 
the transfer of clients but we also had to tackle the training of new RMs. We used a case-based system where a real case would be given to the 
new RM and the case had the solution solved by a senior RM would also act as the mentor for that particular problem. The implementation of the
application involved two connected databases for RMs and clients, as well as a database for assets which each client had. There was also two 
applications to deal with the matching algorithm and the GUI but as my role was to create and operate the databases, those applications are 
not in this GIT.

The application won first place in the Deloitte Problem Set.
